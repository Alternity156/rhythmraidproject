This is a personal project with the idea of making levels in the style of tab-target MMORPG raids (i.e. Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft) while having to be on time with attacks.

I am hopeful this idea is fun, but most likely only appeals to a very selected few individuals.

The current state of this project is unplayable. I want to make the editor at the same time as making game mechanics, so the editor will most likely be made, at least in a rough shape, before playable levels are a thing.
